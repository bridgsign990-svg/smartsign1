BridgeSign – Word Assembler
===========================
Watches the stream of recognised letters and assembles them into words.

Word boundary  → hand disappears for >= BOUNDARY_SECONDS
Sentence boundary → no new word for >= SENTENCE_PAUSE_SEC

The assembler works in both modes:
  • letter mode  → tick() is still called but results are ignored by caller
  • word mode    → caller uses the returned dict to update the UI
